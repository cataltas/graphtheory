# Graph Theory Research (Summer 2018)
This research focused on attempting to prove Tuza's conjecture, a matching and packing unsolved problem on triangles, for complete graphs with four vertices. This project required and used theory on graphs, hypergraphs, and optimization. It was undertaken by three undergraduate students Camille Taltas, Kyle Duffy, and Enhao Fend, and was supervised by graduate student Abdul Basit who had previously done some work on the problem. All of our contributions during that period can be found in the paper present in the repository, Fractional_Matchings_and_Covers__Observations.pdf, with our initials next to each proof.
